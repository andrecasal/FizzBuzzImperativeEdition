# FizzBuzzImperativeEdition

The simplest possible implementation of FizzBuzz using imperative/procedural programming in Java.

## About FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem used in interviews to test basic programming skills. The rules are:

For numbers 1 through 100:
* If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
* If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" 
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (15), print "FizzBuzz"
* Otherwise, print the number

## Programming Paradigm

This implementation demonstrates **imperative programming** - the most straightforward approach using:
- A simple `for` loop for iteration
- Basic `if-else` conditional statements
- Direct console output
- No abstractions, patterns, or complex structures

## Running the Code

```bash
# Compile
javac FizzBuzz.java

# Run
java FizzBuzz
```

## Comparison with Other Editions

This repository is part of a programming paradigm showcase:

1. **FizzBuzzImperativeEdition** (this repo) - Simple, procedural approach with for loops and if statements
2. **[FizzBuzzFunctionalEdition](../FizzBuzzFunctionalEdition)** - Functional programming with streams and predicates
3. **[FizzBuzzObjectOrientedEdition](../FizzBuzzObjectOrientedEdition)** - Over-engineered enterprise OOP solution with patterns
4. **[FizzBuzzDeclarativeEdition](../FizzBuzzDeclarativeEdition)** - Configuration-driven, rule-based approach

Each demonstrates different programming paradigms and approaches to solving the same problem.
